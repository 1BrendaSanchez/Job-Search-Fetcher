# Job-Search-Fetcher
This is an example of how you would build an application to assist in your job search.

## How It Works:
1.) Fetches jobs from Indeed API (if you have an API key) or scrapes LinkedIn if no API is available.
2.) Filters the top 5 job listings based on your criteria.
3.) Sends job notifications via email and Telegram.
4.) Runs automatically when executed.

## NOTE: This code is intended to be an example. Please ensure you are complying with all applicable laws, regulations, and terms of service.
### Considerations:
* Legal and Ethical: Ensure compliance with Indeed's Terms of Service and Robots.txt file. Some websites prohibit scraping, and violating these terms can lead to legal issues or IP bans.
* Technical Challenges: Websites may implement anti-scraping measures like CAPTCHAs or IP blocking. To mitigate this, you might need to use techniques such as rotating IP addresses or mimicking human-like browsing behavior.
